# hardsphere_snookered
This project simulates a two-dimentional gas and animates it to illustrate and investigate the laws of thermodynamics. A gas is described by multiple balls bouncing inside a circular container.

Here is a list of the files.

hard_spheres.py : creates the Ball class and the Container class which inherits from Ball.

Simulation.py : initialises the systems and creates methods for collisions.

test_singleball_collide.py : tests the Simulation class for a single ball in a container.

test_balls_collide.py : visualises collisions between multiple balls in different cases.

theromo.py : investigates conservation laws, the relations between variables and the velocity distribution through plots.
